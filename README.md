# Conway's Game of Life
I couldn't find an existing version of the Game of Life that ran efficiently enough in Python, so I built one myself.

More improvements to come...

Inspired by [Joseph Bakulikira's](https://github.com/Josephbakulikira) [PyGame version](https://github.com/Josephbakulikira/Conway-s-Game-of-life---Python) of the Game of Life.
